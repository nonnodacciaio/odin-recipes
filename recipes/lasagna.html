    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a
        type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to
        an
        Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato
        sauce),
        vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like
        Italian
        seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted
        after
        baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting
        baked
        pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
